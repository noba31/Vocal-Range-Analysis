# Vocal-Range-Analysis
This repository has been created to analyze how the height of a singer is a significant correlating factor in determining the vocal range of the singer.

# Problem-Statement
Consider the dataset stored in the file singer.txt. It contains heights in inches of the singers in the New York Choral Society in 1979. The data are grouped according to the voice part. There are four voice parts, namely, Bass, Tenor, Alto, and Soprano. The vocal range for each voice part increases in pitch from Bass to Soprano. Perform an exploratory analysis of the data by examining the distributions of the heights of the singers in the four groups.
